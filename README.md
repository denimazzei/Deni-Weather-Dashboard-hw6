# Deni-Weather-Dashboard-hw6

This assignment requested the implementation of 3rd-pary APIs to develop and build a dynamic weather dashboard that runs in the browser to feature updated HTML and CSS. By using the OpenWeather One Call API, my goal was to extract specific data to display the following information:

1. City Search
2. Current weather conditions as well as a 5-day future forcast below
3. Save all city searches via local storage to search history
4. The weather conditions include date, icon to represent conditions visually, the temperature in Farenheit, humidity %, and the UV index - which is presented by a color as to whether favorable, moderate, or severe.
5. Below is a 5-day future forcast that displays all of the same features as above relative to each day listed.
6. The city search history is displayed as an unordered list below the search input. These results can be clicked on and the user is taken back to those results.
7. The user can also clear search history and this information is removed from local storage.

This assignment was complex yet excited as it really develops the use of real-world application and the call back to APIs. Below is a screenshot and screen recording of my deployed application:
